+ improve connection testing
	@ refactor out test code to just use the service by sending an intent, CRUDConnectionActivity
	No this design is better. Less complicated easier to manage, tradeoff copy-paste code.
	Although CRUDConnectionActivity could send a broadcast to the service, populate the buddylist
	+ implement populate buddy list via onReceive on XMPPService
	It seems stable...
	
- more testing
