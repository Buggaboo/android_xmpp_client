TODO 31-05-12
- implement setAway, unavailable, available etc. shared dialog by all activities
- make translatable to different languages, use the prefix technique in CRUDConnection.
- limit number of messages on the chat screen, add button on top of the List, to load previous messages
- fix presence updates, too many false positives
    - determine bug in the ****ing library (low prio), by comparing with a different smack lib for android
    - read and digest this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1919489/unable-to-get-presence-of-roster-by-using-smack-openfire
    	apparently all you need to do is Thread.sleep(ms); this is unacceptable for the most important service
      - take action by implementing AsyncTask
- create test accounts on other providers
    - microsoft
    - meebo.com
    - local
- create an icon
- remove the stupid header (aka titlebar), or add custom stuff there
- prettify interface
- modify notification to show a picture
+ improve connection testing
	@ refactor out test code to just use the service by sending an intent, CRUDConnectionActivity
	No this design is better. Less complicated easier to manage, tradeoff copy-paste code.
	Although CRUDConnectionActivity could send a broadcast to the service, populate the buddylist
	+ implement populate buddy list via onReceive on XMPPService
	It seems stable... 
+ turn on debugger and put checkpoints on the listeners for outgoing messages in XMPPService (determine if this is a server or client issue), problem solved
  => it was a jabber thread issue, forcing the reuse of the thread is not appreciated by google?
+ implement notifications (XMPPService.ACTION_MESSAGE_INCOMING)
	+ implement removal of notifications of a buddy, when the messages have been seen.
	  => chatactivity sends a broadcast with the buddy_id, notification service receives the buddy_id and fetches all the message_ids connected to the buddy_id
	+ eliminate cause of crashes (cause: competing threads for the database)
		+ test new idea! sleep! put in a delay. 5000 ms. -> succes!
	+ turn on in the onCreate of XMPPService
