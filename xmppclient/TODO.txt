+ improve connection testing
	@ refactor out test code to just use the service by sending an intent, CRUDConnectionActivity
	No this design is better. Less complicated easier to manage, tradeoff copy-paste code.
	Although CRUDConnectionActivity could send a broadcast to the service, populate the buddylist
	+ implement populate buddy list via onReceive on XMPPService
	It seems stable...
- fix presence updates, too many false positives
    - determine bug in the ****ing library (low prio), by comparing with a different smack lib for android
- prettify interface
- create test accounts on other providers 
- more testing
