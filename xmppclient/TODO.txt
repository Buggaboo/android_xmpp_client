+ improve connection testing
	@ refactor out test code to just use the service by sending an intent, CRUDConnectionActivity
	No this design is better. Less complicated easier to manage, tradeoff copy-paste code.
	Although CRUDConnectionActivity could send a broadcast to the service, populate the buddylist
	+ implement populate buddy list via onReceive on XMPPService
	It seems stable...
- fix presence updates, too many false positives
    - determine bug in the ****ing library (low prio), by comparing with a different smack lib for android
- determine why some outgoing message packets do not arrive, are they being sent at all? Is it due to the bad library or inconsistent use of threads?
- prettify interface
- implement notifications (XMPPService.ACTION_MESSAGE_INCOMING)
- create test accounts on other providers
    - microsoft
    - meebo.com
    - local
- create an icon
- remove the stupid header (aka titlebar), or add custom stuff there
- more testing
